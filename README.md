algorithm project showing comparison between Dijkstra and A* search algorithms

Introduction
Design an user friendly interface which would help the user to navigate his/her destination places in the city. It would comprise of the following features:-
		1. Sorting of path on the basis of distance to be covered.
		2. Path on basis of time taken according to traffic.
		3. Optimal path which would reach destinations via user entered place in way.
		4. Path on the basis of transport chosen by user.
